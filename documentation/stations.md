# Stations

The _Stations_ page allows users to get travel time, vehicle miles traveled, speed, and volume for a specific station.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the tutorial, users will be able to:

* select a station
* understand, navigate, and use the _explore_ options

### Step 1: Select a station
Select any single station on the map. The stations are grouped by the direction of traffic (north, south, east, west). Once a station has been selected a pop-up will provide the name of the station and location, and a link to view more information (Figure 1).

### Step 2: Current station information
Clicking on the _Click here to view more_ link will open to a summary of current station information page. Figure 2 shows a screen shot of the summary stations page. The top panel shows a more detailed map and the location of the station designated by a star. Additional information provided on this page include highway name, number of lanes, milepost of the station location, and the length of the station data it represents. If available, the option to click on the downstream station, the station for the opposite direction, or the upstream station will be highlighted available. If these options are unavailable, the buttons will be grayed out.

The bottom left panels show the vehicle hours traveled (VHT) and travel time. The bottom right panel shows the speed and volume per lane per hour (VPLPH). Data presented in these two panels shows the current daily information. For historical and additional information click on the _Explore_ buttons located at the upper left corner of either of the plots.

### Step 3: Explore: Two quantity chart
The _Two Quantity Chart_ page provides more detailed information about the station, options for plotting different quantities, concomitant weather data, and the option to download data.



### Step 4: Download data

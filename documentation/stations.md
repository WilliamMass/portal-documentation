# Stations

The _Stations_ page allows users to get travel time, vehicle miles traveled, speed, and volume for a specific station.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the tutorial, users will be able to:

* select a station
* understand, navigate, and use the _explore_ options

### Step 1: Select a station
Select any single station on the map. The stations are grouped by the direction of traffic (north, south, east, west). Once a station has been selected a pop-up will provide the name of the station and location, and a link to view more information.

### Step 2: VMT/Travel Time and Speed/Volume

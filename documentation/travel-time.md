## Travel Time
Users are able to select a route to compare four weeks of travel time data against average travel time.

### Route selection
* _Routes_ Users can either use the drop down menu select among several predefined routes, or use the map to create a route by selecting several continuous stations.

* _Start Week_ Only four weeks of data can be plotted and downloaded at one time. The start week begins on a Sunday.

_Reliability weeks_
The number of reliability weeks chosen determines the number of weeks used to calculate average travel time. Reliability is in reference to the level of consistency of observed average travel time. Figure 1 shows the reliability weeks set to six.

_Standard_
The Standard plot shows detailed travel time for each day per week. Users can zoom in on a specific time frame on the plot by clicking at the start date of interest and drag to the end date of interest (Figure X).

_Aggregate_
The Aggregate plot shows hourly average travel time per hour aggregated by user-specified days of the week per week. For example, Figure X shows average travel time (y-axis) per hour (x-axis) per week aggregated by Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

_Yearly_
The Yearly plot shows hourly average travel time per hour aggregated by user-specified days of the week per year. Figure X shows hourly average travel time per hour aggregated by Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, per year.

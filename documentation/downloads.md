# Downloads

## Introduction
In addition to being able to download data from each page in PORTAL, the _Downloads_ page provides the opportunity to download data over longer time frames over multiple locations.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the tutorial users should be able to:

* Understand the parameters of each download option for each section
* Know what data is being downloaded (e.g. variables and units)

### Highways
Highway data can be downloaded from this section by selecting the start and end date of interest, days of week, format, highway of interest, and temporal resolution. Multiple highway sections can be downloaded by holding the ctrl key and clicking on the desired highway.

The following data are provided:
_Variables_
starttime:
resolution: temporal resolution of frequency of data collected
detector_id: detector id along selected route
speed: average speed of vehicles traveling per hour that pass the detector
volume: number of vehicles per hour that pass the detector
occupancy:
countreadings:
delay: vht minus the time it would take a vehicle to travel at the maximum permitted speed on a segment.
traveltime:
vht: (vehicle hours traveled) total hours traveled within a segment by all vehicles
vmt: (vehicle miles traveled) total miles traveled on a segment by all vehicles

To get distance traveled divide vmt by volume.

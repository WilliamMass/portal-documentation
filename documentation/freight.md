## Freight (Vehicle Length)
Users are able to select a station and explore what percent of traffic is freight versus non-freight, the change over time of of freight versus non-freight traffic, and vehicle counts by speed ranges over time. The primary purpose of collecting vehicle length data is to analyze freight versus non-freight traffic where vehicle lengths less than 20 ft are non-freight traffic. PORTAL uses "freight" to distinguish these two traffic types.

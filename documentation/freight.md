# Vehicle Length (Freight)

## Introduction
The primary purpose of collecting vehicle length data is to analyze freight versus non-freight traffic where vehicle lengths less than 20 ft are non-freight traffic. PORTAL uses "freight" to distinguish these two traffic types.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the tutorial users should be able to:

* select a station and set plotting parameters
* explore and understand what percent of traffic is freight versus non-freight, the change over time of of freight versus non-freight traffic, and vehicle counts by speed ranges over time

### Step 1: Select a station
Users can select a station by either choosing a station from the "Station" drop down menu or by clicking on a station on the map represented by the green dots. Vehicle length data is currently only available from ODOT.

### Step 2: Select a start and end date
Select a start and end date of interest by either entering the date under "Start" and "End", or by using the calendar menu.

### Step 3: Select a metric of interest
Select the metric of interest by using the drop down menu under "Measure". The two metric options for plotting are either vehicle length or speed.  

### Step 4: Select a resolution
Select the time resolution of interest by using the drop down menu under "Resolution". The options are 15 minutes, one hour, and one day.

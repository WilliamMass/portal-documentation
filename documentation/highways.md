# Highways

## Introduction
The _Highways_ page allows users to observe changes in speed, volume, and VMT along a selected length of a highway.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the tutorial, users will be able to:
* select a segment of highway determined by milepost
* understand and navigate options for plotting speed, volume, and VMT

### Step 1: Select a highway
Use the drop down menu at the top of the page select the highway of interest.

### Step 2: Select a segment of the highway by using milepost
Use the _Start Milepost_ and _End Milepost_ to select the segment of highway of interest. The _Start Milepost_ is the south end and the _End Milepost_ is the north end of the highway. By default, and reset, the updated plots will show the full length of the freeway.

### Step 3: Select date and time range parameters
Select the date range of interest by using the _Start_ and _End Date_ options. The _Start_ and _End Time_ options allows comparisons of specific times across the selected date range (e.g. evening rush hours).

### Step 4: Select figure plotting options
_Ungrouped/Standard_

_Grouped/Aggregated_

### Step 4: Figure of aggregated data for speed, volume, and VMT

### Step 5: Chloropleth map of hourly speed along user defined segment of highway

# Highways

## Introduction
The _Highways_ page allows users to observe changes in speed, volume, and VMT along a selected length of a highway.

## Learning objectives
By the end of the tutorial, users will be able to:
* select a segment of highway determined by milepost
* understand and navigate options for plotting speed, volume, and VMT

### Step 1: Select a highway

### Step 3: Select time parameters

### Step 2: Select a segment of the highway by using milepost

### Step 4: Figure of aggregated data for speed, volume, and VMT

### Step 5: Chloropleth map of hourly speed along user defined segment of highway

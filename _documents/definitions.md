This file contains definitions of the key quantities/metrics used in the PORTAL web site and related general information. 
This page is not complete at the moment, please contact the PORTAL team if the definition you need or information 
you want is not on this page.


*Stations Page: Volume (VPLPH):*  Volume of vehicles passing by this location expressed as Vehicles per Lane per Hour. 
This metric scales data to an hour no matter what resolution is selected. In addition, this metric averages over lanes, 
so the result is always a per lane, per hour figure. 

*Stations Page: Average Volume:* This metric calculates the total total volume of vehicles recorded by the selected detector(s) 
during the time resolution selected and averages the volume for that time period over the days selected. For example, if 5 min resolution is selected and  a one day time range is selected, this metric will provide the volume during each 5 minute period during
that day. If a multiple day time range is selected, the metric will provide the average volume over those days for
each 5 minute time period during the day. This metric does not scale to an hour and does not average over lanes.
Note: currently broken when using Group and selecting days of the week. Also, clearly this metric needs a new name.

This file contains definitions of the key quantities/metrics used in the PORTAL web site and related general information.

you want is not on this page.


*Volume (VPLPH):*  Volume of vehicles passing by this location expressed as Vehicles per Lane per Hour. This metric scales 
data to an hour no matter what resolution is selected. In addition, this metric averages over lanes, 
so the result is always a per lane, per hour figure. 

*Average Volume:* Total volume of vehicles recorded by the selected detector(s) during the time resolution
selected. If multiple days are selected, volume will be averaged across those days. For example, if 5 min resolution 
is selected and  a one day time range is selected, this metric will provide the volume during each 5 minute period during
that day. If a multiple day time range is shown, the metric will provide the average volume over those days for
each 5 minute time period during the day. This metric does not scale to an hour and does not average over lanes.
Note: currently broken when using Group and selecting days of the week. Also, clearly this metric needs a new name.

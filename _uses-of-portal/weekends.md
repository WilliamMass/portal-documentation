The Weekend Congestion and Incident Analysis project analyzed weekend congestion and incidents on US 26 EB and I-84 WB for 2012
through 2018 and shows an increase in congestion over those years. The slides include heatmaps for Saturdays and Sundays for the
years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 for those two freeways. By stepping through the heatmaps in the presentation linked
below, you can see the increase in congestion.

The project was part of a the Summer 2019 Explorations in Data Science class at PSU.

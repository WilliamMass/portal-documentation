Aggregations of courser time resolutions (>= 5 minutes ) on the _Stations_ are not running properly. The issue and a solution has been identified. We will post an update when the solution has been implemented and aggregated data are available on PORTAL.

The previous daylight saving time issue was fixed within 24 hours of the initial posting.
